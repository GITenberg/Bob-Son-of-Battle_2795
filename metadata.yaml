description: Two sheep farmers and their sheepdogs engage in a years-long battle to
  prove their superiority in handling sheep with the son of one caught between. Bob
  is the last of the famous shepherd line of Gray Dogs of Kenmuir. His alcoholic master,
  Adam M'Adam, doesn't believe the dog is as good as his forebears, until Bob gives
  his life to save the flock from a ravenous wolf of the Scottish highlands.
